Hi, all,

In preparation for our final exam this Friday at 7 p.m., we have a sample exam for you to look at.  This sample exam is meant to show you how the test system works; sample exams with course material content can be found in the git repo.

You can view the sample exam at https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/sample_exam/

This exam, like the final, is timed.  For this sample exam you have 1 hour to complete it from when you first load that page -- so if you load it now to look at it, and then come back to complete it tomorrow, that 1 hour will have expired, and you will not have a chance to see how the system works.  This exam will no longer be active at 6:30 p.m. on Friday (30 minutes before the real final starts), so you will have to view it before then.

We'll be in touch about other exam details in the next day or so.

Best,
-Aaron Bloomfield
