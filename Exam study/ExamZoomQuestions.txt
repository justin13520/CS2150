Can you provide an example of what kind of questions we can expect?

Explain runtime of dikrja/prim's: e*log(v)

In replicated (non-virtual) multiple inheritance, two parent classes share the same instance
of a class as a parent. T or F?

What assumptions can we make about the questions and will we be able to contact TAs?

When a question talks about arrays, should we read it as vector? or only the primitive
