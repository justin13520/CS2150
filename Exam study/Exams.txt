Spring 2020
1) int main(){ int x = new int(5); }
2) Organization-know what all the function are without their bodies
   Minimize the potential for errors
   Readability
3) We use reference instead of pointers to modify the object/variable itself instead
   of a copy of that object. 
   We would use references if we didn't want the thing the reference is referring to
   to change what it's referring. We can also use it so we can directly modify the object
4) Deallocates s. If we try to access s after the deallocation, we would get
   undefined behavior. 
5) There is no operation in which doubly linked list is constant that single linked list
   is not, so there is no such operation that exists. An operation that is constant
   time for vector but not for the other two is accessing a "block". Vectors can use
   the [] operator to instantly get something, while linked list have to iterate to
   wherever the thing to look for is.
6) Allow data structures of different types. Efficient, flexible
7) A linked list because you can pop the front and push the back, exactly what is
   needed for a queue
8) To give the rules and standards of operations, 
		IF WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT, PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT?
9) 011111011111111111111111 --> 1.1111111111111111 * 2^63 offset = 2^6 - 1 = 63
10) Starting from the right, break the binary into 4 bit chunks and convert those to
    their hex values. 0000 1000 = 8 -> 0x08
11) (4 * 5^2) + (1 * 5^1) + 3 = 108/8 = 13 R 4, 13/8 = 1 R 5, 1/8 = 0 R 1,
    413 base 5 is 554 base 8
12) 0x0102 (little endian) --> 0x0201 (big endian) --> 0000 0010 0000 0001 = 2^9 + 2 = 258
	0000 0001 0000 0010
13) To get permission to modify and access the file
14) In order for 10n to be Big Theta n, 10n = cn, 10 = c, there exists a constant 
    where it's true, so it is in Big Theta n
15) A pointer can point to anywhere while an array base name point solely to the
    starting point in memory of the array ?

1) Better cache allocation (spatial locality), less memory because no pointers, 
   constant time access with [], able to use more efficient searches
2) We would want to pass a pointer by reference so that we actually modify/update the pointer
   we are passing in. An example of this would be the list iterator we used in lab 2
   because we need to remember what the iterator is pointing to, not a copy that we 
   can't access.
3) A dangling pointer is a pointer pointing at something that was already freed. A memory leak is 
   something that was allocated and is still there after the program terminates
4) c, c, b, a, b
5) bool BinarySearchTree::isIdentical(BinaryNode* a, BinaryNode* b){
	bool identical = false;
	if(a == nullptr && b == nullptr){
		return true;
	}
	if(a->value == b->value && a->right == nullptr && a->left == nullptr && b->right == nullptr && b->left == nullptr){
		return true;
	}
	if((a->right && b->right) || (a->right == nullptr && b->right == nullptr)){
		identical = isIdentical(a->right,b->right);
		if(!identical)
			return false;
	}
	else{
	  return false;
	}

	if((a->left && b->left) || (a->left == nullptr && b->left == nullptr)){
		identical = isIdentical(a->left,b->left);
		if(!identical)
			return false;
	}
	else{
	  return false;
	}
	return identical;
}

6) lea rax, [9*rbx+17]
7) The activation record would contain local variables, parameters, and return address
8) A priority queue is any data structure that can insert and delete/find min. A binary heap
   must have an order and structure property.

10)8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15
11) Go through it normally and then recheck a shortest path. If it comes back smaller, there is
    a negative cost. This would take n^3 time because n^2 to get the original and another n to get
    check that path.
12) 
13)Dijkstra's algorithm runs in Big Theta v^2 because it has to check for each node, all of its
   edges, which in worse case connects to every other node.
14)Side roads->Main road->Highway->Main road->side road
15)Rational* rptr = (Rational*)malloc(sizeof(struct Rational));
16) A shared inheritance is when an object inherits a field from two parent classes that are the same.
    Replicated mulitple inheritance is when an objects inherits two things that are the same, but
    represent different things. 
17) Pipeline character, which the output from ./a.out is inputted into tail -1
18) Bash scripts are good running scripts of commands and bad for .
