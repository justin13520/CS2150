; Parameter 1 is a pointer to the int array, rdi
; Parameter 2 is the size of the array, rsi
; Parameter 3 is the target number to be found, rdx
	; to be found iteratively, loops 
	; Return type is int, -1 if not found
	;; rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9

linearSearch:
	;; basic idea: compare i to size-1 first to know whether still in bound
	;; [rdi] compared to target, if equal, set rax to index, r10 
	;; if not, increase rdi by 4 (actual i++), inc r10 to rep i++, jump back to loop.
	;; if i = size -1 and still not found, set rax to r11, -1
	;; if i = size , return rax

	;; prologue
